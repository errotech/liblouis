#i used "lowword" opcode to avoid any possible confusion with punctuation marks
- - (ثم من)
  - ⠦⠹ ⠍⠝⠴

#sixth rule: if the following abbriviations come as single words, they should be abbriviated normally. but if they come as a part of bigger word, dots 36 must be placed before the character that represents the abbreviated word.
#this is the most problematic rule for me so far. i should define every contraction twice, one with the "word" opcode, and another with the "partword" upcode.
#when i used the "word" upcode, a big problem happens with backtranslation: if the contraction is part of a word, nvda automattically assumes that the character before the dots 36 is a contraction as well and automatically add it. an example if the "word" upcode is used:
- - وليس
#correct
  - ⠺⠤⠇
#incorrect
#- ⠤⠺⠤⠇
# The first character in the word is not an abbreviation, yet nvda assumes that it is a seperate word as soon as i put dots36 after it, because it thinks it is a dash symbol, not a contraction indicator. in grade1, the word "وليس" will be "ولماليس"
#another example:
- - لربما
#correct backtranslation
  - ⠇⠤⠗
#incorrect backtranslation
# - ⠤⠇⠤⠗
#to temporarily work around this issue, i used the "lowword" upcode. this resulted in good backtranslation, but disabled the use of all these abbreviations if they come connected with punctuation marks, which is not desirable.

# as a seperate word:
- - ليس
  - ⠇
- - مثل
  - ⠍
- - ذاكر
  - ⠮
- - شيء نحو الهدف
  - ⠩ ⠝ ⠉⠓⠙⠋
#due to the use of "lowword", they will not be translated next to punctuations.
- - قريب جدا.
#correct
  - ⠘⠟ ⠚⠲
#incorrect, which is the current state:
# - ⠘⠟ ⠚⠙⠁⠲
#as part of a word:
- - الخير
  - ⠉⠤⠭
- - فإذا
  - ⠋⠤⠪
- - مثلما
  - ⠤⠍⠏
- - ونحوه
  - ⠺⠤⠝⠓

#seventh rule: if the letter that procedes any of these abbreviations consists of dots 1 2 and 3 only, they should not be abbreviated.
#here i will use the match opcode to define the 6 possible characters that can come before these contractions.

  - ⠷⠇⠊⠡
